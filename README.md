# hidwaan

**`hidwaan`**: A Tagalog word meaning rift, discord, conflict, dispute, disagreement, or strife.

This is a simple Discord-like chat application for practicing different programming languages.

The goal of this project is to specify basic backend features and implement them in different frameworks or programming languages for practice.
The same applies to the frontend, where different front-end frameworks or libraries will be used for practice.

This will allow me to swap between different front-end and back-end implementations.


## Features

- Basic user registration & authentication
- User Session Management
- Server and Channels Management
- Realtime Chat via Websockets
- Personal Message


## Imposed Limitations

As I build different versions of the backend and frontend, I will specify
different limitations depending on the things I want to practice or learn from.

For example:
- Don't use ORMs, and force myself to use raw SQL
- Use only vanillajs for the frontend
- Implement my own Websocket libraries
- Roll my own authentication


Because this project is for practice only, don't expect the code to be secure for production.
These limitations will make me do my own research with different industry standards
being implemented and to really have a better understanding on how things work under 
the hood.
